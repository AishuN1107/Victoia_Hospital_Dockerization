## 📌 About The Project

The Victoria Multi Speciality Hospital Appointment Booking System is designed to streamline how patients schedule, cancel, and reschedule appointments.

Here's why we built this:

- To reduce human error and workload in appointment management.
- To enable patients to handle appointments across multiple devices.
- To demonstrate full-stack development with real-time and cloud integrations.
